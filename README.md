Model for Assessing Hillslope-Landscape Erosion, Runoff and Nutrients as described in the trilogy in ESPL (2008):

"A Transport-Distance Approach to Scaling Erosion Rates: Model Development and Testing" by John Wainwright, Anthony J. Parsons, Eva N. Mueller, Richard E. Brazier, D. Mark Powell and Banti Fenti, Earth Surface Processes and Landforms 33, 813–826, 962–984. 1113–1128, doi: 10.1002/esp.1624, 10.1002/esp.1623, 10.1002/esp.1622


Marker-in-Cell version as described in JGR-ES (2012):
"A new approach for simulating the redistribution of soil particles by water erosion: a marker-in-cell model" by James Cooper, John Wainwright, Anthony J Parsons, Yuichi Onda, Tomomi Fukuwara, Eichiro Obana, Ben Kitchener, Edward J Long and Graham H Hargrave, Journal of Geophysical Research – Earth Surface 117, F04027, doi:10.1029/2012JF002499         

Continuous version is described in:
Eva N Müller EN, Britta Tietjen, Laura Turnbull, John Wainwright (submitted) 
"Ecohydrological modelling of land degradation in drylands: feedbacks between water, erosion, vegetation and soil", Journal of Geophysical Research – Biogeosciences.         

Current executable version in: 
Mahleran_v1.2.3/dist/Release/MinGW64-Windows/

To run in standalone mode, copy the executable file from the above folder and put it in a separate folder on the computer, together with the mahleran_input.xml file, the Input folder with the appropriate input files, and make a new Output folder for the output.

To test the model is working correctly for you, please use the datasets in one of the following folders in Input: 
Test2_Abbott_300700, Test_2_Wise_110801, input_p1, input_p2, input_p3, input_p4

The MAHLERAN Manual is in the file MAHLERAN Manual 1_02_1.pdf and gives instructions on how to develop new datasets to run the model.
