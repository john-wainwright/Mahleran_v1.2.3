!JW Apr 2017 see original code below.  All reading and most allocation now done in read_parameters_from_xml_file
!initialize
dt_vegetation = 14		!turnus in which vegetation dynamics is calculated, at the moment set to 14 days

allocate (c_veg (2, no_species, nr2, nc2), source = 0.0e0, stat = ierr)

!now included in source terms above
!c_veg (:, :, :, :) = 0.
!mort (:, :, :) = 0.
!gr (:, :, :) = 0.
!disp (:, :, :) = 0.

! initialize vegetation cover (as was read in in interstorm and storm sections)
!JW Apr 2017 Implies hard coding as only shrub and grass cover included
c_veg (1, 2, :, :) = shrub_cover (:, :) / 100.
c_veg (1, 1, :, :) = cover (:, :) / 100. - shrub_cover (:, :) / 100.	!cover contains both the sum of shrub and grass cover
